Guardians of secrets, old as time,
In their silence, a sublime rhyme.
Mountains standing tall and proud,
Whispering tales to the clouds.
Majestic peaks that touch the sky,
Where eagles dare and angels fly.
Cloaked in snow or bathed in sun,
Their silent vigil has begun.

Guardians of secrets, old as time,
In their silence, a sublime rhyme.
Mountains standing tall and proud,
Whispering tales to the clouds.
Majestic peaks that touch the sky,
Cloaked in snow, where eagles fly.
Silent giants, standing tall,
Guarding valleys, rivers small.

Their shadows cast a tranquil scene,
In hues of blue and emerald green.
Mountains, with their silent song,
Echo nature's strength all day long.
Majestic peaks that touch the sky,
Where eagles dare and angels fly.
Cloaked in snow or bathed in sun,
Their silent vigil is never done.

A testament to time's own might,
In day's warm glow, or cold moonlight.
Mountains stand, both bold and grand,
The timeless guardians of our land.

Where eagles dare and angels fly.
Cloaked in snow or bathed in sun,
Their silent watch has just begun.

In their silence, a sacred chime.

Monuments to life's demand.
