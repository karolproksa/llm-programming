Majestic peaks, towering high,
Silent sentinels against the sky.
Their jagged edges, sharp and bold,
Crowned with blankets of purest gold.

Ancient guardians, steadfast and grand,
Witnessing life like shifting sand.
With rugged beauty, they inspire,
Mountains, forever, we shall admire.
Majestic peaks against the sky,
Where nature's wonders never die.
Their rugged edges touch the clouds,
Where silence sings, whispers aloud.
A refuge for dreams, bold and free,
Mountains stand, in serene decree.
Their ancient wisdom, unwavering height,
Enduring sentinels, bathed in light.
Majestic peaks touch the sky with grace,
Silent giants, standing tall and bold,
Their grandeur leaves us humbled, lost for words,
Guardians of nature, brave and old.

Sapphire lakes mirror their breathtaking view,
Snow-capped crowns kissed by dawn's golden hue,
Mountains stand firm, in eternal embrace,
A testament to strength, in every phase.
In majesty they stand, reaching for the sky,
Their peaks kissed by sunlight, clouds drifting by.
Silent sentinels, guarding earthâ€™s ancient core,
A testament to time, to strength and evermore.

Their craggy faces weathered, like lines etched in stone,
They whisper tales of eons, of secrets yet unknown.
With every jagged edge, a story to unfold,
Oh, mountains grand and steadfast, forever they shall hold.
In everlasting glory, they rise high,
Majestic peaks that touch the azure sky.
Their rugged beauty, a sight to behold,
Whispering tales of giants, brave and bold.

Snow-capped crowns shimmer in golden hues,
Guarding secrets only nature can choose.
Oh, mighty mountains, guardians of peace,
Your strength and grace forever shall not cease.
In peaks adorned with snow so white,
Mountains stand with wild might.
They reach for skies in tranquil grace,
Guarding secrets of time and space.

Their ancient souls so deeply rooted,
Eternally strong, never muted.
Oh, mountains grand, forever I'll be,
Enraptured by your majesty.
Majestic peaks, soaring high
Touching the boundless, open sky
Silent sentinels, wise and old
Guarding secrets, stories untold

Through misty valleys, rivers flow
As nature's symphony starts to grow
Mountains stand tall, their glory untamed
A testament to time, forever famed.
In majestic heights, mountains stand tall,
Their craggy peaks embrace the heavens above.
They guard nature's secrets, both big and small,
A testament to resilience and lasting love.

Their slopes, an artist's canvas, blank and pure,
Where endless stories of nature unfold.
With each ascent, a soul finds its cure,
Amongst the mountains, adventure takes hold.
Majestic peaks touch the sky,
Silent witnesses as time goes by,
A canvas of nature's awe and might,
Where heaven and earth gently unite.

In their presence, souls find solace,
Their grandeur a testament to grace,
Mountains, guardians of dreams and lore,
Forever standing, forever more.
Behold, the mountains stand tall and grand,
Rising above the earthly land,
Their peaks pierce the heavens so high,
Touching the canvas of infinite sky.

Majestic and steadfast, they tower above,
A testament to nature's endless love,
Whispering tales of ages untold,
Mountains, forever captivating, never grow old.
Majestic peaks adorned with snow,
Guardians of Earth, towering tall they grow.
Their stoic presence whispers tales untold,
Of ancient wisdom and secrets withheld.
With jagged edges, they touch the sky,
And catch the sunbeams as they pass by.
Mountains, mystical realms, untouched and pure,
A sanctuary where dreams and hope endure.
